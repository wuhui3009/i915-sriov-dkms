# Linux i915 and xe driver (dkms module) with SR-IOV support for linux 6.12 ~ 6.19

This repo is a code snapshot of the i915 and xe modules from the mainline linux kernel with SR-IOV support ported from the [intel/mainline-tracking.git](https://github.com/intel/mainline-tracking.git)

**Disclaimer:** This repository is a community project and is **NOT** affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Intel Corporation. This kernel module is a port based on the mainline kernel and Intel's implementation and may contain experimental and unstable features. 
Please use it at your own risk.

## Warning

This package is **highly experimental**, you should only use it when you know what you are doing.

You need to install this dkms module in **both host and guest!**

## Required kernel

Required kernel: **6.12.x ~ 6.19.x**

For older kernel (v6.8 ~ v6.12), please use the [2025.07.22](https://github.com/strongtz/i915-sriov-dkms/releases/tag/2025.07.22) release.

For v6.1 ~ v6.7, please use [intel-lts-v6.1](https://github.com/strongtz/i915-sriov-dkms/tree/intel-lts-v6.1) branch instead.

It is recommended that to upgrade to a supported kernel, the older branches will no longer be maintained.

**Note on Secure Boot:** Loading out-of-tree kernel modules requires Secure Boot to be disabled. If you require Secure Boot, ensure you are using a signed kernel and follow the instructions in the [UEFI Secure Boot Enabled Configuration](docs/secure-boot.md) guide to sign the module.

## Required Kernel Parameters

Starting from the current version, this repo provides both the i915 and xe drivers.
You can switch between them by modifying the kernel parameters.

### i915

```
intel_iommu=on i915.enable_guc=3 i915.max_vfs=7 module_blacklist=xe
```

### xe

```
intel_iommu=on xe.max_vfs=7 xe.force_probe=${device_id} module_blacklist=i915
```

**Xe module currently does not support MTL (Meteor Lake) and LNL (Lunar Lake) platforms. Please use i915 instead.**

Replace `${device_id}` with the output from `cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/device` command

## Manually create Virtual Functions (VFs)

```
echo 7 > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/sriov_numvfs
```

You can create up to 7 VFs on Intel UHD Graphics

## Generic Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues that prevent the system from booting properly (e.g., a hang or black screen), you can temporarily disable the module by modifying the kernel command line at boot.

### GRUB2
1. At the boot menu, select the desired kernel and press `e` to edit the boot parameters.

1. Locate the line starting with linux and append `module_blacklist=i915,xe` to the end of it (preceded by a space).

1. Press **F10** or **Ctrl+X** to boot.

### systemd-boot

1. Press `e` at the boot menu to edit the kernel parameters.

1. Append `module_blacklist=i915,xe` to the end of the existing line (preceded by a space)

1. Press **Enter** to boot.

Once the system is up, you can inspect the kernel logs to troubleshoot. 
If the module remains unstable, follow the [Uninstallation](#installation-guides) steps in your distribution's installation guide to remove the module.
